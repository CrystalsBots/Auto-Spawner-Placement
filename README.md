# Auto-Spawner-Placement
this bot was made for JartexNetwork Immo facs and was used in total of 2 maps when the value was insanely high, you can chat from it with .s and do .check {side}, all you need is a slime wall that it will place on.

The way you use this bot is you will make a wall of slime blocks and then place a block like 20-30 blocks away from it, u will /tpahere your bot or so ".s /tpa ..." in your console. after its there ( with empty inventory ) u will type .check {side} for example .check west it will return how many spots it will place on ( Maximum 500 ). After that it will automatically buy it, fly and place nonstop untill u dont stop it.

! Make sure you have /f fly enabled, so if u tp it from spawn do ".s /f fly" before using it. Otherwise it wont work.
